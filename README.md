Higher consciousnes!

Truth is the basis for creating. Everyone wants freedom, happiness, love, health, but many people ignore the truth to achieve this. 
This truth lies within ourselves and the environment around us. 
We often believe things or prefer to go along with lies to be liked or to belong to a group. 
We do this out of laziness or to blame someone else. 
These principles are used extensively in our society especially by religions.

To be able to consciously create "we must" first know what we are dealing with. 
Namely, these are occult groups. 
Occult means nothing more or less than hidden.
These groups have hidden occult knowledge by manipulating previous societies and transforming them into the present one.
The knowledge at issue here is mainly that of natural law, how consciousness works and the invisible spiritual laws, which control the consequences of human behavior. 

How can we best approximate truth to apply natural law?

Who determines natural law?
Natural law equals truth. It is something present in nature and beyond human control.

What determines natural law?
Truth is equal by nature and cannot be determined by man.

Where is the natural law?
Truth is present in nature, it is there forever, and this is what human will have to approximate as best he can, in order to live in harmony with nature.

When does the natural law apply?
Truth is this moment and what has always been.

Conclusion truth is absolute and forever.

Why is natural law present in human(s)?
Human is one with nature. This truth is found in our genes, the bleu print in humans. These are formed, before we become a fetus. So these are forever present and we cannot change them (anymore). One does try to do this (chemically) and to some extent this will disrupt the connection with our nature. However, this will not change the truth, which was, is and will be.

How is natural law present in nature?
This is translated by mRNA into our DNA. This is the antenna of us humans, to the higher consciousness.


Conclusion: truth always remains the same!
Truth remains objective, meaning it is not based on people's perceptions.
Truth does not waver, bend or change. It does not matter whether anyone believes it, knows it, see it, or wants to see it. It does not change and will never change. The past and present remains the same.

Truth or perception 
When people hear truth, people have the most incredibly weird comments. Like that is your truth or my truth or relating it to God, or something else that is completely irrelevant.
When someone takes off their glasses the truth may look different but remain the same.
Perception does not equal reality or truth!

Belief or truth
We are quick to believe what we "should" believe, this is because of the information that comes at us all day long. The telephone, TV, radio, school, roadside signs, rules, etc.. 
We believe this and don't even think anymore and just follow it. 

Ego
This can already be seen as an attack on the human ego, namely the bigger ego one has the more that their perception is important and accurate to them. 

With that comes principles to find the truth. 
In this, proteins play an important role. 
These proteins can be influenced by chemicals, trauma but most importantly: what we believe. 

Chemicals 
Everything that affects our brain and genes such as drugs, food, what we put on our skin and what we breathe in etc. affect the access and processing of the information, which is stored in our DNA.

Trauma
We are affected by trauma from an early age, getting too close to the water can cause trauma. 

What we believe 
Is the most important thing here. Everyone can swim from birth that is in our genes. From the time we can walk we are kept away from water because our parents are programmed that we can drown. This fear is magnified with incidents by media, education etc.... 

If we believe that trauma is real, this part of the information in our DNA will no longer be read because the protein will no longer want to read that part of our genes.   
If we grow up in the environment of this trauma, the people in this environment will also start to believe it. 
Because of this we put locks on many mental cages for ourselves. 

Can we unlock them by accepting the truth?

You can ignorantly do something and hope that it will turn out well or you can go out and investigate first and eventually reach a state of knowing. 
For this you need knowledge of the natural laws. 
People, who follow ignorantly, lack that knowledge. These people have willfully ignored all the information, often just out of convenience.
But if you ignorantly jump or fall off a high cliff there are just as many consequences.
Either way, you cannot escape the law of nature. 

Therefore consciousness is something of knowing and ignorance.
There is no difference in this according to natural law. 
The truth is our own responsibility

If we want to create we go back to the natural laws and how it works.
The principles are also in nature and we will approach them as closely as possible.
Thereby the principles are absolute and forever and to be measured against the truth! 
It is up to us humans to live by them. 

In your reality you can think about avoiding the harmful chemicals and resolving traumas but the most important thing is, stop believing, see the truth as close as possible with the principles from the natural laws.

Why are the principles present in nature?
These principles are hidden or read for our proteins in our genes (the bleu print). 
These do exist forever and we cannot change them (anymore) (perhaps chemically). 
We will just have to learn to read them again without disruption. 

If we want our proteins to be able to read the genes completely again, it means that we read the truth completely, which in turn is translated by our mRNA to our DNA. 
With this we restore the antenna to our consciousness.

How can we change our principles to the truth?
If you want to create this change, action is required! 
The most important thing is to find or see the truth to create. 
Our present reality is based on false belief, on a illusion.

Some people say that change happens in the heart or head, which is certainly true. 
But at the end of the day, real change only happens with courage and action! 





Principles are often learned on a false belief such as religion, government, media, education, family circumstances etc. 
For example, you cannot steal according to the natural law.
Do we change the natural law in religion we may confess, in government a judge must decide it, according to media it must be proven first and in school they may just take away your marker if you use it unauthorized, in a family look away to avoid trouble. 

But according to natural law, the spell thatâ€™s on it makes no difference. There is always damage to the environment and the balance must be restored. Either by yourself or by the environment. Creating an imbalance, always has direct consequences in yourself and in your environment. It is because of this that we are in a society that destroys itself.

Therefore, it is important to follow the principles from nature and not commit crimes, which often occur out of fear or mind control, such as:
Theft, sexual assault or rape, murder, lying (withholding truth), using violence or compel.

But what is the truth when you look at these acts that we all label as crimes?

Theft
Speaks for itself. We all know that stealing is wrong.
But, many people will see taxation as a good thing, whereas, a criminal organization demands money for protection, they see it as wrong. Fear of solving it themselves or belief in the government, which in fact breaking the same natural law.

Sexual assault or rape
When someone is vaccinated against their will, it is also, in fact, rape. 
Fear of being outside the group or belief in your ego do not change the fact that your body, against your will, is being invaded.

Murder
If you kill someone to prevent a murder or multiple murders, they can still lock you up for murder.
Because of this, there is fear of defending yourself and the belief that killing is murder at all times, whereas circumstances matter enormously in determining whether or not something is the right thing to do.

Lying (withholding truth).
When you lie or withhold truth, you deny another person the right to discover the truth about something or someone.
Fear, of not being accepted or the belief that your ego is more important do not change that.





Violence or compel
Again, we will say, "Speaks for itself," but if someone else starts hitting you, or forcing you, you may defend yourself.
Fear of defending yourself or being forced, belief in the government using the same tools, still goes against this natural law and will, no matter what, cause an imbalance in the balance.

The consequence of ignoring the natural laws and accepting and often even defending and condoning the crimes committed is more trauma or fear.
Trauma comes from fear causes you to stop seeing certain things thus holding back development of yourself.
Belief in something or someone, which is pure mind control, causes you to relativize principles.
Which eventually adjusts your proteins so that your genes (bleu print) can no longer be fully read. 

When we know the truth, we can turn that knowledge into action.

1.	Acknowledge, first of all, that there is a problem.
Then you can address and overcome fear-based denial. Denial will only make the problem worse (slavery).

2.	Recognize that symptoms are merely consequences of underlying causes. 
Instead of treating symptoms, it is better to accurately diagnose (= by way of knowledge) the cause of the problem. In doing so, you come to understand what cause certain symptoms originate in.

3.	By means of the obtained knowledge you should take the action, which is necessary to correct the cause, which led to the problem.

When we know how we think to see the truth, we can create.
Here in is the brain structure, behavior, health and understanding crucial. 
The 3 basic structures of the human brain are:

The R complex (reptilian brain). 
This is the lowest conscious part of the brain, responding only to stimulus. Fight or flight mode this is also called and nicely describes what we "have to" think all day (basic survival functions). Symbolic the male part.

The limbic system (mammalian brain).
This is the middle brain in narcissists, psychopaths this part of the brain does not function properly. This part is numbed by the protein. This is where the chronic disorders, trauma, birth disorder etc... matter. Symbolic the female part.



The Ne cortex (human brain).
Consciousness the newest part of the brain, where electrochemical activity takes place that make us human. With higher thinking functions such as, logic, intuition, creativity, etc....

Future
Since truth is in the now and past, you can change the future. 
The term truth can always be used or referred to.
When one gains the ability to perceive what is now, and has happened is called consciousness. 
Now one has the ability to recognize patterns. 
The more consciousness is developed, the more one sees the truth. 
Which in turn affects your environment (the Cloud).

The most important qualities you need to create from truth are time and where/what do you give attention.

We believe at this time
At birth to write a name and number in a system that we link to the Gregorian calendar.

This is a calendar, which is for physical evidence only.
Of birthdays, holidays but also planning of education, law, salary, career, news, marriage, children etc....  
The narrowing of our consciousness already takes place here.
We do not even ask questions about other things, we are only concerned with this planning. 

Spirituality is out of society!

In other words, this calendar is our dogma that we for ourselves have created or has been forced upon us.
Here the proteins are already being modified that we no longer read our genes completely.
With this calendar they control our consciousness, body and thinking.

For example: 
Maya called this calendar the Haab, they used it only for state accounting (tax). 
Tzolkin calendar they used as personal calendar and lasts 260 days, namely 13 intentions to create and 20 aspects to create. 
Astrologically 12 signs per year but again different signs per day. Etc.... 
Ancient cultures also looked at influences from outside our consciousness. 

What were they looking at? 

Our brain is the tool for thinking, which literally gives one space, to see time, which with this calendar, is used to teach us things with physical evidence.
If one perceives something that there is no physical evidence of, you perceive it unconsciously and will not (be able to) or misapply it. 
Ego is created by programming or trauma how that you see or want to see yourself.
This calendar is held hostage the pattern can be seen and is also shown to us.
As long as we follow it we walk into a trap that is determined for us.
In other words the protein has already adapted to no longer read your genes in their entirety.

No difference from a computer or robot.

If you can let go of this and surrender everything to your consciousness, you will move (out of your mind) beyond your thinking, or in other words to your intuition (your soul, heart). 
In this you lose all stress and your anxiety will disappear! 

Then you can come out in state of knowing everything (your genes can be fully read again) in the area you spend the time and attention on.

Consciousness is always attached to:
Time (in the now)
Place (where you are internally and externally)
What you are looking at
How you look at it

Free will is the choice of what you want to look at.
Consciousness is not just us humans but everything around us (the cloud).

Then language comes in. 
We are immediately sent to school to learn spelling (spells, spellcasting).

If you put a person down with a light above them you get an idea.
When you see this picture in front of you, there is much more action going on than the word idea on paper.
This is perceived by your intuition (genes) since we often see images when we are tired after a day hard work, weâ€™ve come to see it as entertainment.

We think in language that leads us astray. If we started thinking in symbols and communicating with each other, things would be much easier.
If one can spend months giving us a 1.5-hour presentation in the form of a movie or other program. 
How many symbols do we get presented in this day and age. The same goes for a curriculum etc....




Our parents copy what they have been taught. 
In school we learn to copy what others tell us. 
The same goes for high school, where we are allowed to develop in our copied reality (illusion). 
Should we then have a career with our ambition, we live in the future for recognition. 


Information is often no truth, only confirmation of what you think you already know. 
We are so in search of information but in doing so we also walk into a trap that is determined for us.

If we want to be free we will learn to read our genes completely with truth. 
This is what the G stands for in the Freemason symbol, among others. 

Since we are taught to develop the two first hemispheres separately, which is symbolically reflected in entertainment such as the axe, split coconut, another brick in the wall (Pink Floyd), a heart of stone, medusa (media), etc... we now know what the ego means, namely a blockade between these hemispheres, the male and female part. Often one of these 2 is more strongly developed due to trauma (female) or ego (male). 

When we begin to understand that our programming is only meant to keep us away from real knowledge, we begin to understand that we have learned nothing about life. 
Only to maintain a system for a few people who keep real knowledge away from us to control us like slaves.

If we want to develop, the trivium is important tool.

Basic principles of trivium:

Who, what, where and when determines the definition of the problem.
That could be spelling, input or knowledge!

Why determines the definition of the problem.
This can be logic, concepts or processing!

How did the problem arise, determines the definition.
That can be by rhetoric, speech, output, wisdom!

Always use this order!

With this we no longer learn what to think but how to think.
If we want to create together we will "have to" reach a higher consciousness.

You canâ€™t change something that has been created, you can create something new.
